        <p>I'm Jacquez Patterson, born and raised in Charlotte, NC and I'm 27 years old. I'm very excited to get
            started
            with my coding career. After graduating highschool in 2013 I've had a very diverse experience and set of
            training in the work force, ranging from customer service to manufacturing. So I have worked from the
            ground
            up. I have pretty extensive experience working with teams as well. Lastly I secured my certification in
            computer coding by attending a Computer Coding Boot Camp hosted by the University of North Carolina at
            Charlotte. I look forward to being able to add my unique experience and expertise to your team. Below is
            some of my work that I have learned and can apply, please have a look.</p>
